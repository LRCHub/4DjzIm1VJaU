[00:00.75] I can see you now, you're ultra step
[00:04.87] Got your best shoes on
[00:06.81] That I happened to pick out
[00:10.38] Been moving on, you're moving on
[00:14.27] You're moving on
[00:16.49] Now don't get me wrong
[00:18.61] Letting go was right
[00:20.60] But I can't shake the feeling of you by my side
[00:26.02] You're moving on, you're moving on
[00:30.09] You're moving on
[00:32.77] I can feel your heartbeat while you're kissing someone else
[00:39.83] You met her drinking in a dive-bar asking 'bout books you've read
[00:48.43] I can feel your heartbeat while you're kissing someone else
[00:55.55] You met her drinking in a dive-bar asking 'bout books you've rеad
[01:01.60] You've read
[01:03.71] I'm going out tonight
[01:05.94] In my best bluе dress
[01:07.80] Got my red pumps on
[01:09.84] God, I feel depressed (Why, girl?)
[01:13.33] Been moving on, you're moving on
[01:17.37] You're moving on
[01:19.72] Oh, we're pulled back in
[01:21.63] We can never be right
[01:23.02] Couldn't get the code you wanted out of my mind
[01:29.03] You're moving on, you're moving on
[01:32.91] I'm moving on
[01:39.41] 
[01:35.51] I can feel your heartbeat while you're kissing someone else
[01:42.68] You met her drinking in a dive-bar asking 'bout books you've read
[01:50.69] I can feel your heartbeat while you're kissing someone else
[01:58.16] You met her drinking in a dive-bar asking 'bout books you've rеad
[02:03.49] You've read
[02:08.99] 
[02:05.78] I feel it bubbling up, bubbling up
[02:09.98] Bum-bum-ba-dum
[02:14.10] I feel it bu-bubbling up
[02:18.28] I feel it bu-bubbling up
[02:22.29] I feel it bu-bubbling up (Don't wanna feel it bubbling)
[02:26.25] I feel it bu-bubbling up (Don't wanna feel it bubbling)
[02:29.74] I feel it bu-bubbling up (Don't wanna feel it bubbling)
[02:34.29] Bu-bubbling up
[02:38.64] I can feel your heartbeat while you're kissing someone else
[02:45.61] You met her drinking in a dive-bar asking 'bout books you've read
[02:53.99] I can feel your heart
[02:55.85] I can feel your heartbeat while you're kissing someone else
[03:00.72] (You're kissing someone else)
[03:03.62] You met her drinking in a dive-bar asking 'bout books you've read
[03:08.49] (You're kissing someone else) Ha-ha-ha
[03:11.66] I can feel your heartbeat while you're kissing someone else
[03:16.45] (You're kissing someone else)
[03:19.33] You met her drinking in a dive-bar asking 'bout books you've read
[03:24.85] You've read
[03:27.55] I can feel your heart while you're kissing someone else
[03:34.92] You met her drinking in a dive-bar asking 'bout books you've read
[03:40.76] You've read
